# Missing traditional flashcards?
Hey there. Are you also a fan of keeping things traditional, and a fan of CSS like me? This mini-mini-project was designed to deliver your wish, and in less time! Enjoy studying with authentic flashcards, including handwriting font-families and card shadows.

This git contains two files: `cardsetup.html` and `cardstyle.css`. `cardsetup.html` was quite a useless file, but it was just to show you how to structure things if you're a beginner. Feel free to tinker around with the `cardstyle.css` file!

# Installation and setup
**Do NOT download any files!**
1. View the raw file for HTML's setup
2. Copy the code for the Front and Back structures
3. Paste it in the card style editor in Anki

4. View the raw file for CSS setup
5. Copy the code and paste it in the styles
6. Customise to your liking

Donezo! Enjoy :)
